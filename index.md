## Hello! I am Lingfeng Zhou.

### About me

I am a PhD student at Beijing Normal University.

I am particularly interested in watershed hydrology and water quality modeling. Specific research interests include: (1) watershed-scale heavy metal modeling; (2) weather generator; (3) uncertainty quantification.
